"""Userspace driver for the MediaTek MT7601U (2.4 GHz USB Wi-Fi dongle).

Wires the ported stages into the Driver contract: EEPROM decode and MAC programming,
firmware download, post-firmware hardware init, the channel tune, and the RX descriptor
decode feeding the frame parser.

Transmission is ported. Injection writes a real TX descriptor on the verified path and is
byte-identical to the kernel's own over 7680 recorded de-auths (capture-6). Receiving works on
hardware: the RX URBs are submitted between mcu_cmd_init and write_mac_initvals, where
dma.c:517 mt7601u_dma_init sits -- armed earlier the chip never streams a byte.

State of the port (see docs/porting/METHODOLOGY.md for the gates each stage passed):

  EEPROM read + decode     verified 160/160 ops on two cold-boot captures
  firmware download        verified 78 and 77 ops on the same two captures
  station memory clears   verified 13/13 burst ops on two cold-boot captures
  hardware init            ported, register-for-register equivalent to the kernel
  channel tune             verified 55/55 recorded tunes in monitor mode
  RX descriptor decode     unit-tested, and delivering real frames on hardware
  TX descriptors           byte-identical to the kernel over 7680 recorded de-auths
  transmit queue           ported; USB-level completion verified, air unconfirmed
  association / keys / AP  not ported -- blocks PMKID, WPS, EvilTwin
